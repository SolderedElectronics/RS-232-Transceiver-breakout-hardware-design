The RS-232 is a standard and very popular protocol for communication between two devices. It is a full-duplex protocol which means it can receive and send data at the same time, and data is sent at voltages from + 3V to + 15V for a digital "one" and from -3V to -15V for digital "zero". This provides a more secure environment for data transmission which is resistant to noise or interference, which is why the RS-232 is often used in industry. This module converts serial communication to RS232.
